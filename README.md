# probablysort
Probably sorts faster than you were. Uses mergesort (implemenation from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18761766/mergesort-python) and something I made I call collapse sort. I'm still looking for a similar implementation of the thing I call collapse sort to be able to say I am not the first to make it, and I'm waiting for a reply from several of my professors.

Time complexity no slower than the lesser of O(nlogn) and O(m) where m is the distance between your highest and lowest numbers that need to be sorted, even in a completely unsorted list.

Space complexity no larger than O(nlogn)
